1,the food thats being served in our cafe in all schools to our kids
2,We have such a large staff group that it is hard to get to know everyone.  It seems as if XXXX High School is a different school from the XXXX High Career Center.

However, I have to go complete the Safe-T process due to being new to SC.

40,The sports team have a difficult time winning games...
41,too much paperwork and too much testing
42,"By treating our kids as if they are still in Elementary and not allowing them to grow socially. Our kids are not allowed to communicate in the mornings and I feel that's a little too much for this age group. At this age kids are finding out ""Where they fit"" I feel we are hindering them from that social skill by making them sit in the hall in the AM and not talk. I also don't like our kids fearing our  AP administration. Students should never fear anyone that works in a public school. "
43,"The physical environment of the school could be better. The main part of the school is old and therefore has the problems that come with an aging building - leaky ceilings, moisture in classroom, mildew smell, mice, etc. The outside area, especially in the back where the kids have their recess, is littered with loose gravel and broken glass, and dirt covers  the court they play on.  It would be nice if the appearance of the school and the grounds of the school reflected the goodness that goes on inside of it."

I'm disheartened by their lack of commitment and zeal for collaborating and working as a team which could not unify our school but our community as a whole.  Quite honestly, I hope they embrace the vision and mission of the new administration soon or seek other employment opportunities.

I feel that even though YYYYY is a bigger community that class sizes should be equal with what other XXXX Elementary schools have. This hurts the children not the teachers.

248,Some administrators  do not poses the high level of dedication to student learning that our teachers poses.  Some administrators are not consistent in the support they provide teachers and staff.   Some administrators can be found to not be engaged in work related task while teachers are teaching during and after school.  Some administrators give very little interest to educating themselves on the best practices that should take place in our classrooms.

Class sizes need to be smaller to allow teachers to teach more effectively. Also placing kids in classes based on their academic ability so that all kids in a class are at the same level (whether that is at grade level, behind or ahead) would greatly benefit the students and make it easier for the teachers to teach effectively."

306,Some safety issues need to be looked at. There is no place to put students when a discipline issue arises. The HR department needs to be looked at for effectiveness.

I would also like to see us be able to offer more programs in the future for our Career and Technology classes that align with our countries employment needs.

Now that students know they aren't going to fail no matter what, it is a complete disservice to them.  This is not a true reflection of how the real world is going to treat them when they grow up.  I think we are setting them up for failure."

In several aspects of the school culture School leaders rule out of fear and intimidation rather than support and respect.   Teachers are often reprimanded or scolded over the school intercom for the entire student body to hear.  School leaders express to teachers about creating relationships and being positive with students, yet the school leaders yell and scream at students when students do not behave in a manner they deem acceptable.  



The school building is not safe especially after hours.  The front office has a glass shield and visitors are routed through the office before entering the building.  However, visitors could enter any student hallway without first going to the office.  Main doors to buildings are unlocked to allow for transitioning throughout the building.  Obviously this is the make-up of the building and little can be done to fix it besides constructing a new building but I do not feel this is safe for our students and staff."

Yes they meet the calorie and nutrient guidelines but this is not helping students when they want eat what is provided. I personally as an educator would not eat it either and will not allow my children to eat it.

Most times students are spoken with briefly by administrators and them sent right back to class.  We as teachers, feel this is not a perceived as a consequence to the student and it under minds our authority.  It is hard to give quality instruction to students when there are certain students who constantly interrupt your class and only receive a ""talking to"".  "

Our administration continuously requires meeting after meeting, without considering how tired and overloaded our teachers are. Teachers are required to attend three meetings per week, often working past normal hours for no compensation. Classroom teachers are also required to go to recess every day, often resulting in no break at all throughout the day. It's no wonder the morale is low. "
425,Planning periods taken away for meetings. Lunch and recess duty everyday. Having every thing micromanaged.  Behavioral problems being rewarded.

427,"This is my first year at KES and it is so much better than the school I left, I have no complaints."

436,"Some negative attitudes of the teachers who tend to act a bit ""spoiled"" when work or assignments change within our work day. They moan about it rather than just doing their job. Attitude trickles down to the students"
437,The lack of resources.
438,
439,Teacher morale is at an all time low.  We are constantly in meetings and have few breaks throughout the day.  Teachers are tired!  Teachers that have less classes throughout the day could assist classroom teachers more. 
440,"Often we don't teach to reach all learners, we tend to target those kids right in the average margins, we often assume students who need extra support or maybe are slow learners must be special ed. etc. "
441,"Meetings!  We have an abundance of meetings that we are required to attend.  We have SAT meetings every other Monday during our planning.  We have to stay after school every Tuesday until 3:30 for team planning.  While this time is nice to plan, there are many times that the time is taken up doing paper work and other clerical things.  We meet every Wednesday during planning for PLT.  We send home Thursday folders every Thursday and they have to be packed on Thursdays during planning.  We have to meet every Thursday afternoon for Faculty Meetings.  IEP meetings are also scheduled during planning times.  We have very little time to plan for instruction and get materials ready to engage students in their learning.  For the first time in years, I have to take much of my work home with me just so I don't fall behind.  "
442,"I feel that the district should support our school, as well as all elementary schools, by providing a science lab housed with materials and an instructor. Our school had a room available but no instructor or established program supported. This should be a program that runs in collaboration with the classroom teacher to support both the science standards and STEM requirements.  

We also need additional take home reading materials for our students to use.  Our supply is wearing thin."
443,There are too many meetings that interfere with instructional planning.
444,"Lack of discipline, 

lack of support for teachers with discipline issues,

 having to stay until 3:30 twice a week,

 being micromanaged, 

meetings during teacher planning time, 

teachers all have to go to recess with the kids, 

having to call the office to get someone (if you can find someone) to leave the room to go to the restroom because of no breaks during the day

students that are always in trouble are the ones that get the attention while the good kids are hardly even spoken to by principal, but the bad ones get hugs and prizes all the time.

teacher morale is VERY LOW because of all these problems and many are wanting to leave because the stress so bad. We get more and more training and no time to implement or plan for anything we learn and if we are told one more day we have to stay late to do our planning.....

We've already been told not to make appointments on Tuesday or Thursday, then Wednesday was added. When are we supposed to see the dentist or get a hair cut/??????"
445,"I realize that we need to have meetings and analyze data but, we loose lots of valuable planning time when we have multiple meetings."
446,"The lack of technology, master teachers, and the unhappy climate due to low-teacher morale.  I feel that some important items are ignored that need to be addressed."

We have been fortunate to be able to manage our growing pains with an immense amount of district support, however the constant influx of students provides daily management challenges.  I am proud of our teacher's willingness to be flexible and to create classroom communities that help our students be successful, even in less than ideal circumstances.  "

473,
474,
475,I would like to see our school celebrate diversity more. 
476,
477,I do not like the way we assess the F & P testing. There should be an opportunity where we can finish testing in a week in order to best help and develop small groups so we are not wasting 6 weeks of instruction. 
478,I dislike our dilapidated building that is so humid that our desks and papers are wet each morning. It smells of mold and mildew which is unhealthy for students and staff.

555,"The fact that our class sizes are continually rising and now are at about 30 per class is a problem.  Couple that with the fact our Science and Social Studies classes only get half the time as Math and ELA, students and teachers are at a disadvantage when compared to other students in the district."
556,That not everyone goes by the same rules

577,N/a
578,There is little communication from one school to another.  Elementary -- Middle -- High.
579,We are slowly making improvements on school climate but I wish that we had more positive natural support for our school and practices. I think of it as school spirit. I am hopeful that with the middle school initiative of Paying it Forward some positive climate changes will take root and bring us back to a more considerate mentality.

Last year a district-wide change in our pacing guide was made and NEVER shared with me from administration. 



Leadership roles are not always given to the most qualified. Sometimes the least opinionated are chosen, for that reason."

606, 
607,School leadership community is very limited
608,"We do not collaborate with our encore team because of no common time to meet with them.  While we are close as a grade level, we are completely separated from all the others.  I realize part of this is due to our size, but we need to make more connections with other teachers."

Currently, the 8th grade guidance counselor and 8th grade administrator do not have an office desks.  While this may seem minimal; we are having difficulty storing confidential paperwork and maintaining a sense of organization without the appropriate desk space we had previously.  The majority of my papers are still stored away due to having to relocate to a different office.  We love what we do, and will go to great measures to make sure everything runs smoothly; however, not having the proper office essentials has proven to be quite a challenge.  "

677,I dont there there is any moral for the staff. I don't feel like the leaders try to get the employees to do things together or to bring us together as a group.l do not feel like there is any support from the leaders of this school. I don't like that all staff is not treated the same. Different rules for different folks. I wish that there was more parent support.  I don't like that it doesn't always feel like a safe environment. Some doors are left unlocked during the day.

LHS cafeteria staff is awesome and our new manager, Shirley does her very best! However;  I feel many of our students do not eat healthy foods at home due to having to raise  themselves. Many of our students do not eat but maybe one meal a day that is wholesome and that meal is eaten at school. There should not be restrictions on the amount of cafeteria food. I understand it is not good for our students to eat a huge tray of French fries, etc., but our students need to eat. How can we resolve this? "

I understand that the school's scores are not that great on the report card but I feel like I'm being punished because of it.

Two students could do the same thing but because of who they are or who their parent is, one will get in severe trouble while the other gets a pat on the back. Parents have the last say so when it comes to instruction/homework. Many parents will go straight to the principal and the principal will side with the parent and throw the teacher under the bus. The principal will also discuss issues (personal or not) she is having with other coworkers in front of other coworkers. I find this very unprofessional.

1251,"The follow through of things promised.  I am still waiting for my smart board to be installed.  It is in my building, but still not put up in my room.  I asked for an extra student computer, which came this week.  I was so thrilled, however, it does not work."

1271,"I wish we had more to offer our students. There are other schools that use chromebooks and ipads, as well as other forms of technology. It would be nice if we had the same access to technology here. Also, the building here is rather old and I think it would be a good idea to at least have the restrooms updated. "
1272,No printers in the classrooms
1273,
1274,Our scores do not reflect how hard teacher work.
1275,The schedule
1276,There is a large portion of our school's population whose parent(s) do not participate in or support us.  
1277,I least like how the demands of working in a low ses school often means teachers spend much time completing paperwork that often takes time away from them improving instruction.

1287,

1289,The lack of discipline enforced
1290,
1291,"Not ALL of our teachers are giving their best!!! This is very sad for me to see.  When you are this far into school and we are still giving worksheets and not moving them forward....very sad.  Administrators have not taken notice of this, or when the come in the teacher gives baloney to them."

1326,"I wish we had more funding for technology in classrooms, one on one aides with students, and we desperately need another exploratory position.  I think it is an outrage that we do not offer these students a language.  EVERY SCHOOL SHOULD OFFER A LANGUAGE!!!!  PLEASE PROVIDE FUNDING FOR OUR STUDENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.  RESEARCH SHOWS THIS SUPPORTS LITERACY GROWTH OVERALL.  DON'T IGNORE RUCKER!!!!!!!!!!  "

1339,"The inconsistency of discipline can be concerning, but I know that there are situations that we do not always know the details about the decision of the administrators.  "
1340,Mystique. Seems to have that wrong side of the tracks aura about it among the community. 
1341,There is not always follow through or review of data as a school/team.
1342,
1343,"I wish that we could get better teachers for certain positions.  We have had a VERY HIGH TURNOVER RATE for the SAME FOUR POSITIONS the last 3 years.  WE DESPERATELY NEED GOOD TEACHERS AT THIS SCHOOL!!!  It seems it is either one or the other, AWESOME teachers, or sub-par teachers.  "
1344,Excessive testing of students.
1345,lack of parental involvement on regular basis for students experiencing academic/behavioral challenges
1346,It can become very difficult working with families who are not supportive of their child's education and encourage bad behavior.

I  feel we could use more teachers to decrease class size at all grade levels."
1371,
1372,
1373,I do not have anything that I like the least about the school.
1374,What I like least about this school year so far was spending so much time fining 3 level of Fountas and Pinnell.  As a teacher this was not helpful.  I only need the instructional level to guide my students.  This was a unrealistic goal for teachers to obtain in 2 1/2 weeks with 25 students or more. 
1375,There is not one thing that I do not like about my daily job and/or relationships at my school.
1376,
1377,Quantity of meetings. Seems that some could be sent out via email or done within other meetings. 3 meetings a week is a lot when you are preparing for your classroom daily.

1407,Nothing
1408,Too many meetings
1409,
1410,
1411,We have a large class sizes that makes it more difficult to have more one on one interventions with students. 
1412,Parents tend to go to social media instead of coming to us for explanations. 
1413,Some teachers are not held to high standards.
1414,"Class sizes are too large. Also, there are too many required meetings that results in many unfinished things that get taken home each night with teachers."

1418,Can't think of anything I don't like.
1419,Playground is very hot in summer time; could use a covered area for primary grades
1420,I think our playground is too far away from the building.  
1421,"We're making progress in this area, but the ability to access both computer spaces and physical spaces with electronic means can be improved.  ID cards and key fobs are great, but one card that can be used to access the building, individual rooms, our lunch account, and our library account would be extremely helpful."
1422,
1423,Nothing. I love ZZZZZ!
1424,
1425,
1426,I don't really have any complaints about our school. Everything always runs smoothly and we are supported by all.
